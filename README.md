## What I'm About

**Data Scientist & AI Engineer** obsessed with turning data into alpha. Currently architecting AI systems that make sense of the world's messiest datasets while building the next generation of financial technology.

**The mission:** Create AI so precise, so unbeatable, that it changes how we think about data forever.

```python
class DataScientist:
    def __init__(self):
        self.passion = ["Machine Learning", "Quantitative Finance", "AI Systems"]
        self.current_focus = "Building production ML that actually works"
        self.side_quest = "Turning financial markets into predictable patterns"
        self.coffee_consumption = "Dangerously high"
    
    def daily_routine(self):
        return [
            "train models that beat benchmarks",
            "find patterns others miss", 
            "deploy systems that scale",
            "fundzzz"
        ]
```

## Current Projects

*"In a world drowning in data, the future belongs to those who can teach machines to swim."*

**Fun fact:** I once explained blockchain to 500+ people and somehow they all understood it. That's when I knew I had a gift for making complex things simple.
